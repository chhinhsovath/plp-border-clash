## Build Verification Process

After each fix cycle:
1. Run `npm run build` or equivalent locally
2. Check for any remaining console errors or warnings
3. Test critical functionality
4. Verify Vercel deployment requirements are met
5. Document any remaining issues for next iteration

## Final Checklist

Before concluding the fixing process:
- [ ] All syntax errors resolved
- [ ] All imports/exports working correctly
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No console warnings in production build
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] API routes (if any) function properly
- [ ] Static assets load correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works across devices
- [ ] Performance optimizations applied where possible

## Emergency Protocols

If stuck on a particular error:
1. Research the specific error message
2. Check Vercel documentation for known issues
3. Look for similar issues in the framework's GitHub issues
4. Consider alternative implementation approaches
5. Document the issue for manual review if automated fixing isn't possible

Start by running a comprehensive analysis of the codebase and provide your first review cycle report.
